Description: The emergence of large single cell RNA-seq datasets facilitates biological discoveries at single-cell resolution. For single cell atlas to be useful to users from all disciplines, it should be organized in an accessible way. 'scfind' builds an index for scRNA-seq datasets and allows fast inqueries involving cell types and feature lists. `scASfind` is built on top of scfind and it adaps scfind to alternative splicing analysis, in addition to gene expression. Quantification of single cell alternative splicing events are performed by `Whippet` integreted in the workflow `MicroExonator`..
