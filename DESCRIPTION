Description: This is a novel computational method to allow for quantitative analysis of cell type-specific splicing events using full-length single cell RNA-seq data. `scASfind` utilizes an efficient data structure to store the percent spliced-in value for each splicing event. This makes it possible to exhaustively search for patterns among all differential splicing events, allowing the identification of marker events, mutually exclusive events, and large blocks of exons that are specific to one or more cell types. The data compression strategy is adapted from `scfind` by Lee et al. (2021).
